/* This header is separate from features.h so that the compiler can
   include it implicitly at the start of every compilation.  It must
   not itself include <features.h> or any other header that includes
   <features.h> because the implicit include comes before any feature
   test macros that may be defined in a source file before it first
   explicitly includes a system header.  GCC knows the name of this
   header in order to preinclude it.  */

   specifying compiler intent are available, use them to determine
   whether the overall intent is to support these features; otherwise,
   presume an older compiler has intent to support these features and
